Inventory-Tracker

Introduction:

This is a personal tool for keeping track of the things you have and where you keep them. It uses the Rails framework as an api and JavaScript as the frontend. The application uses postgresql for the database to store items you'd like to track.

Running the app:

1. fork and clone this repo.

2. cd into inventory-frontend

3. Run the command "python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer" to start the server.

4. Visit localhost:8000 and fill the form to create the items you want to keep track of.

There are more features to be added in the future, please stay tuned.
